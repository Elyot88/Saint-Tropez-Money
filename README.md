# Saint-Tropez-Money

The Project to make a local money, in the famous place in South of France, Saint-Tropez.

This project is brand new from 2018, here is the Plan ; 

Develop the Local economy with a Local tokkens called STM (Saint-Tropez Money) who is possible to exchange with euros and other cryptocurrencies, and that you can spend first, specially with the local partners who signed with our Saint-Tropez-Money Exchange/Paiment contract. For exemple ; Gaio famous nightclub in Saint-Tropez or Le Caf√© who is a restaurant/bar. But it can also be Hotels, shops etc..

The contract is signed first with company's to create a network where the user can spen his tokkens STM.
Hotels, Nighclubs, Shops is our first targets.

A Website will be created in 2018 for development of the differents stages.

An ICO will be make in the year of 2018 to create the tokkens, then the virtual/hardware wallet on an mobile or classic application.
 
Every people who want's to participate is more than welcome for brainstorming and developping the project STM

First we have to make the Tokkens we've look over the web and mineureum was good looking to create it.
But apparently no response by the dev Team. So we need to find another tokken creator based on Ethereum, NEO or another faster blockchain. We don't need a lot of Transactions per second but a minimum of 20 tps(transaction per second) is required.

Secondly we have to create a wallet/application for the future users ; company and customers.

Thirdly we want to have a cryptocurrency who is stable by the price.

In application the customer will create a wallet in a shop, hotel, restaurant or a club , buy the tokkens to put it on the wallet on his phone for exemple.

The seller (from the shop,restaurant,hotel or club) will scan the QR code from the customer's wallet to make the transaction.

The account of the seller will be credited of the amount, less the fees of transactions who will be less than a Standard Visa card.

The point is to make special prices compare to the originals prices (small dicount) if you pay with the STM.

At any time the person can resell or exchange his STM coins.

We are looking for some Blockchain devs and Web devs !
