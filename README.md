# Saint-Tropez-Money Whitepaper

The Project is to create a local money, in the famous place in South of France, Saint-Tropez.

This project is brand new from 2018, here is the Whitepaper ; 

                        Saint-Tropez e-MoneY
        
Develop the Local economy with a Local tokken called STM (Saint-Tropez Money) that is possible to exchange with euros and other cryptocurrencies. You'll be able to spend it, specially with the local partners who signed for our Saint-Tropez-Money Exchange/Payment contract. For exemple ; Gaio famous nightclub in Saint-Tropez http://gaio.club or Le Café that is a restaurant/bar http://www.lecafe.fr/fr/restaurant.html. But it can also be hotels, shops etc.

The contract is signed first with companies to create a network where the user can spend his tokken STM.
Hotels, Nighclubs, Shops are our first targets.

A Website will be created in 2018 for development of the differents stages.

An ICO will be launched in the year of 2018 to create the tokkens, then the virtual/hardware wallet on a mobile or classic application.
 
First we have to make the Tokkens. We don't need a lot of Transactions per second but a minimum of 20 tps(transaction per second) is required.

Secondly we have to create a wallet/application for the future users ; companies and customers.

Thirdly we want to have a cryptocurrency who is stable by the price.

When using the app, the customer will create a wallet in a shop, hotel, restaurant or a club , buy the tokkens to put it on the wallet on his phone for example, could be a  hardwarewallet called Ledger ( usb key). Then, the seller (from the shop,restaurant,hotel or club) will scan the QR code from the customer's wallet to make the transaction.

The account of the seller will be credited of the amount, less the fees of transactions (Our aim is less than a Standard Visa card).

The point is to make small discounts on the originals prices if you pay with the STM, which would in the end be less expensive than paying with Euros/Dollars on a classic paiement system (Crédit/Debit card ) .

At any time, the customer who own a STM wallet can resell or exchange his STM coins.

We will make a list of all the differents companies that have signed up for contracts with us.

Anyone who wants to participate is more than welcome for brainstorming and developping the project STM.

 Best Regards
